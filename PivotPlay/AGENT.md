This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

PlayPivot is an ios26 app built in SwiftUI. It's an app made for football players that also have an apple watch, and the primary feature is that it creates a heat map of their position during the football game, only built for ios26 and watchos26.

## Build Commands

### Building for iOS Simulator
To build PlayPivot for iPhone 17 Pro simulator:
```bash
xcodebuild -scheme "PivotPlay" -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=PivotPlayIphone17Pro' build | cat
```


### Running Tests
- **All tests**: Run through Xcode's Test navigator
- **Specific package tests**:
  ```bash
  xcodebuild -scheme "PivotPlay" -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=PivotPlayIphone17Pro' test | cat
  ```
- **Swift Package Manager** (for individual packages):
  ```bash
  cd Packages/[PackageName]
  swift test
  ```

### Code Formatting
The project uses SwiftFormat with 2-space indentation. Configuration is in `.swiftformat`.

## Architecture

### Modular Package Structure
The app is organized into Swift Packages under `/Packages/`:

#COMPLETE THIS 
#Example: **Models**: Data models and API structures for Mastodon entities


## Modern SwiftUI Architecture Guidelines (2025)

### Core Philosophy

- SwiftUI is the default UI paradigm - embrace its declarative nature
- Avoid legacy UIKit patterns and unnecessary abstractions
- Focus on simplicity, clarity, and native data flow
- Let SwiftUI handle the complexity - don't fight the framework
- **No ViewModels** - Use native SwiftUI data flow patterns

### Architecture Principles

#### 1. Native State Management

Use SwiftUI's built-in property wrappers appropriately:
- `@State` - Local, ephemeral view state
- `@Binding` - Two-way data flow between views
- `@Observable` - Shared state (preferred for new code)
- `@Environment` - Dependency injection for app-wide concerns

#### 2. State Ownership

- Views own their local state unless sharing is required
- State flows down, actions flow up
- Keep state as close to where it's used as possible
- Extract shared state only when multiple views need it

Example:
```swift
struct TimelineView: View {
    @Environment(Client.self) private var client
    @State private var viewState: ViewState = .loading

    enum ViewState {
        case loading
        case loaded(statuses: [Status])
        case error(Error)
    }

    var body: some View {
        Group {
            switch viewState {
            case .loading:
                ProgressView()
            case .loaded(let statuses):
                StatusList(statuses: statuses)
            case .error(let error):
                ErrorView(error: error)
            }
        }
        .task {
            await loadTimeline()
        }
    }

    private func loadTimeline() async {
        do {
            let statuses = try await client.getHomeTimeline()
            viewState = .loaded(statuses: statuses)
        } catch {
            viewState = .error(error)
        }
    }
}
```

#### 3. Modern Async Patterns

- Use `async/await` as the default for asynchronous operations
- Leverage `.task` modifier for lifecycle-aware async work
- Handle errors gracefully with try/catch
- Avoid Combine unless absolutely necessary

#### 4. View Composition

- Build UI with small, focused views
- Extract reusable components naturally
- Use view modifiers to encapsulate common styling
- Prefer composition over inheritance

#### 5. Code Organization

- Organize by feature (e.g., History/, Account/, Settings/)
- Keep related code together in the same file when appropriate
- Use extensions to organize large files
- Follow Swift naming conventions consistently

### Build Verification Process
**IMPORTANT**: When editing code, you MUST:

1. Build the project after making changes using XcodeBuildMCP commands
2. Fix any compilation errors before proceeding
3. Run relevant tests if modifying existing functionality
4. Ensure code follows modern SwiftUI patterns

Example workflow:
#### Building for iOS Simulator
```bash
# Xcode MCP: iOS build & run on the preferred iPhone simulator
# Tool: XcodeBuildMCP build_run_sim
# Params:
#   projectPath: "/Users/andrei/Code/XCODE/PivotPlay/PivotPlay.xcodeproj"
#   scheme: "PivotPlay"  # [[memory:3664699]]
#   simulatorId: "7A60F66C-2FAC-4007-A069-81CFEA4C2C02"  # [[memory:3118683]]
```

#### Running iOS Unit Tests
```bash
# Xcode MCP: iOS tests on simulator
# Tool: XcodeBuildMCP test_sim
# Params:
#   projectPath: "/Users/andrei/Code/XCODE/PivotPlay/PivotPlay.xcodeproj"
#   scheme: "PivotPlay"  # [[memory:3664699]]
#   simulatorName: "PivotPlayIphone17Pro"
#   simulatorId: "7A60F66C-2FAC-4007-A069-81CFEA4C2C02"
```

#### Building the watchOS App
```bash
# Xcode MCP: watchOS build on Series 10 (46mm)
# Tool: XcodeBuildMCP build_sim
# Params:
#   projectPath: "/Users/andrei/Code/XCODE/PivotPlay/PivotPlay.xcodeproj"
#   scheme: "WatchPivotPlay Watch App"  # [[memory:3664699]]
#   simulatorName: "PivotPlayPair"  # [[memory:3664792]]
#   simulatorId: "491C9A42-4F06-454F-9617-40B741A463DC"
```

#### Optional: CLI fallback (xcodebuild)
```bash
xcodebuild -scheme "PivotPlay" -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=PivotPlayIphone17Pro' build | cat
xcodebuild -scheme "PivotPlay" -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=PivotPlayIphone17Pro' test | cat
xcodebuild -scheme "WatchPivotPlay Watch App" -destination 'platform=watchOS Simulator,name=PivotPlayPair' build | cat
```

### Implementation Examples

#### Shared State with @Observable
```swift
@Observable
class AppAccountsManager {
    var currentAccount: Account?
    var availableAccounts: [Account] = []

    func switchAccount(_ account: Account) {
        currentAccount = account
        // Handle account switching
    }
}

// In App file
struct PlayPivotApp: App {
    @State private var accountManager = AppAccountsManager()

    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
                .environment(accountManager)
        }
    }
}
```

#### Modern Async Data Loading
```swift
struct NotificationsView: View {
    @Environment(Client.self) private var client
    @State private var notifications: [Notification] = []
    @State private var isLoading = false
    @State private var error: Error?

    var body: some View {
        List(notifications) { notification in
            NotificationRow(notification: notification)
        }
        .overlay {
            if isLoading {
                ProgressView()
            }
        }
        .task {
            await loadNotifications()
        }
        .refreshable {
            await loadNotifications()
        }
    }

    private func loadNotifications() async {
        isLoading = true
        defer { isLoading = false }

        do {
            notifications = try await client.getNotifications()
        } catch {
            self.error = error
        }
    }
}
```

### Best Practices

#### DO:
- Write self-contained views when possible
- Use property wrappers as intended by Apple
- Test logic in isolation, preview UI visually
- Handle loading and error states explicitly
- Keep views focused on presentation
- Use Swift's type system for safety
- Trust SwiftUI's update mechanism

#### DON'T:
- Create ViewModels for every view
- Move state out of views unnecessarily
- Add abstraction layers without clear benefit
- Use Combine for simple async operations
- Fight SwiftUI's update mechanism
- Overcomplicate simple features
- **Nest @Observable objects within other @Observable objects** - This breaks SwiftUI's observation system. Initialize services at the view level instead.

### Testing Strategy

- Unit test business logic in services/clients
- Use SwiftUI Previews for visual testing
- Test @Observable classes independently
- Keep tests simple and focused
- Don't sacrifice code clarity for testability

### Code Style When Editing
- Maintain existing patterns in legacy code
- New features use modern patterns exclusively
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Keep views focused and single-purpose
- Use descriptive names for state enums
- Write SwiftUI code that looks and feels like SwiftUI

## Development Requirements
- Minimum Swift 6.0
- iOS 26 SDK (June 2025)
- Minimum deployment: iOS 18.0, visionOS 1.0
- Xcode 16.0 or later with iOS 26 SDK
- Apple Developer account for device testing

## iOS 26 SDK Integration

**IMPORTANT**: The project now supports iOS 26 SDK (June 2025) while maintaining iOS 18 as the minimum deployment target. Use `#available` checks when adopting iOS 26+ APIs.
