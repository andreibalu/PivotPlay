# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical stability issues in PivotPlay that are causing crashes, data sync problems, and user experience degradation. The primary focus is on fixing the iPhone crash when accessing Latest Workouts, resolving Watch-iPhone data synchronization issues, eliminating navigation warnings, and correcting heatmap pipeline anomalies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a PivotPlay user, I want to access my Latest Workouts without the app crashing, so that I can review my workout history reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user taps on "Latest Workouts" THEN the app SHALL display the workout list without crashing
2. WHEN there are no workouts stored THEN the app SHALL display a "No workouts yet" placeholder message
3. WHEN workout data is corrupted or missing THEN the app SHALL handle the error gracefully and display an appropriate message
4. WHEN multiple users access Latest Workouts simultaneously THEN the app SHALL prevent race conditions during data reads

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a PivotPlay user, I want seamless data synchronization between my Apple Watch and iPhone, so that my workout data is always available on both devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Watch sends workout data via WCSession THEN the iPhone SHALL receive and process the data without nil context errors
2. WHEN application context data is empty or nil THEN the system SHALL use fallback transfer methods without fatal errors
3. WHEN data transfer fails THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
4. WHEN sync is successful THEN both devices SHALL confirm receipt of data through handshake mechanism
5. IF context transfer fails THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt file transfer as backup

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a PivotPlay user, I want smooth navigation throughout the app, so that I don't experience UI glitches or inconsistent states.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating between views THEN the app SHALL not display navigation controller transition warnings
2. WHEN multiple navigation actions occur simultaneously THEN the app SHALL queue them properly to prevent conflicts
3. WHEN async operations complete during navigation THEN the app SHALL ensure UI updates happen on the main thread
4. WHEN navigation stack is transitioning THEN the app SHALL prevent additional navigation pushes until complete

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a PivotPlay user, I want accurate heatmap data visualization, so that I can analyze my workout patterns effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I tap corners on the heatmap THEN each tap SHALL record unique coordinates without duplicates
2. WHEN the system calculates distances between workout points THEN it SHALL return non-zero values for distinct locations
3. WHEN corner taps occur within 5 meters of each other THEN the system SHALL debounce to avoid duplicate entries
4. WHEN distance calculations are performed THEN the haversine formula SHALL be validated against known GPS coordinates
5. WHEN workout has 15+ location points THEN the total distance SHALL be greater than zero

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a PivotPlay developer, I want clean application logs, so that I can efficiently debug issues without noise from system services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app runs THEN it SHALL minimize XPC/UIIntelligence warning messages in logs
2. WHEN deprecated BTLE APIs are detected THEN they SHALL be replaced with current alternatives
3. WHEN debug logging is enabled THEN only relevant application logs SHALL be displayed
4. WHEN system noise cannot be eliminated THEN it SHALL be filtered to debug level only

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a PivotPlay user, I want the app to handle edge cases gracefully, so that I have a reliable experience even when data is incomplete or corrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN workout JSON data is corrupted THEN the app SHALL decode safely with default values
2. WHEN network requests fail during sync THEN the app SHALL provide meaningful error messages
3. WHEN the app encounters unexpected states THEN it SHALL log the issue and continue functioning
4. WHEN data migration is needed THEN the app SHALL preserve existing user data
5. WHEN memory pressure occurs THEN the app SHALL handle cleanup without crashes

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a PivotPlay developer, I want comprehensive test coverage for critical paths, so that I can prevent regressions and ensure stability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN WorkoutStorage operations are tested THEN unit tests SHALL cover all CRUD operations and edge cases
2. WHEN HeatmapPipeline distance calculations are tested THEN tests SHALL validate against known GPS coordinates
3. WHEN Watch-iPhone sync is tested THEN tests SHALL verify handshake mechanisms and retry logic
4. WHEN navigation flows are tested THEN UI tests SHALL verify Latest Workouts access and heatmap overlay functionality
5. WHEN performance is tested THEN the fixes SHALL not introduce additional CPU overhead
